# Solution Design for Mood Check API
This document contains documentation and artifacts related to the solution design for a REST API that allows the creation of quick mood-check surveys that can be created in real-time and recieve the "mood" of the intended audience in real-time also.

The intent here was to learn and apply [Clean Architecture](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) principles as described by [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin):
- Recent Clean Architecture [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=clean+architecture&sp=EgIIBQ%253D%253D)

## Side-Effects
My intent, also, is to get better as a software engineer by applying Clean Code techniques and perfecting my craft by pursuing a state of continuous learning.
