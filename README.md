# Mood Check API with Node.js
This application is the REST API (aka back-end system) to a public API to support simple (10 question or less) surveys to measure the mood of an udience in a short amount of time. For example, imagine an online content producer (youtuber, vlogger, periscope) who is broadcasting a live show, such a person could create a mood-check survey live about any topic and get feedback/reaction from the audience in real-time. Concrete examples:
- 5-by-5 check: make sure your audio/video feeds are correct
- binary questions: ask audience yes/no type of questions
- multiple choice: poll the audience
- others?

## Other info
My goal with this REST API is to learn/get better at different cloud-based online services for CI/CD Pipeline management
- Using [AWS' Code Pipeline](dox/cicd/aws-cicd.md)
- Using Azure's solution for CI/CD (not started)
- Using Google Cloud Platform's solution for CI/CD (not started)
